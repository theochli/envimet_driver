# READ ME

The purpose of this project is to develop a "driver" to emulate the steps of executing simulations of [Envi-met] (https://www.envi-met.com/) on Windows. We will use the python package [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)to emulate keyboard and mouse inputs to Envi-met, and the combinations of input parameters to Envi-met will be changed in each iteration, according to a pre-defined distribution.
